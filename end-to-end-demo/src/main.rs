//! End-to-end demo.
//!
//! A demo showing how to develop and deploy applications on-top of the Veracruz
//! framework.  Demonstrates provisioning secrets into the enclave via a secure
//! TLS link.
//!
//! We use an oblivious routing example, here, wherein a user wishes to query a
//! map (expressed as a graph of locations connected by roads, along with their
//! approximate distance in miles) without the mapping service knowing where
//! they are starting from, or where they are going.  As a result, there are
//! two principals involved in the computation:
//!
//! 1. The mapping service, which produces the connectivity map and all of its
//!    metadata, which is going to be queried, and also supplies the program
//!    that will actually perform the routing (see the contents of
//!    `test-program`).
//! 2. The user, who issues a "routing challenge" to the mapping service asking
//!    it to compute a route from location `A` to location `B`.  Note that in
//!    this computation, it is the user that will be able to retrieve the result
//!    with all routing shielded from the routing service itself by the enclave.
//!
//! In a real deployment, these two principals will obviously distinct,
//! possessing their own machines through which they interact with the Veracruz
//! runtime, though here for the purposes of demonstrating Veracruz we use a
//! single thread of execution with two different clients to represent the two
//! principals.
